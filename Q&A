Please describe an interest, favorite activity, or hobby of yours. It could be anything: just something you enjoy doing. For this particular answer, please only write up to 60 words and do it in a way that captivates your readers (us!).  
In my free time, I am passionate about expanding my knowledge by reading tech blogs from leading companies such as Netflix and Substack. 
I also value spending quality time with my family and children, which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle.

What is most important to you when you look for a new job? Please be completely honest and transparent about your situation and season of life; we’re not looking for “the right answer”. The more you tell us, the better we can align.  
My primary focus is to work with technologies that challenge and enhance my skills, ideally on projects that provide opportunities for growth and development. 
Additionally, I am looking for a role that offers a competitive salary, with the potential for growth beyond my current compensation.

Everyone learns differently. How do you learn best? And what’s something new that you’ve learned in the past few months? Big or small, we’re curious!  
I typically begin by reading tutorials to familiarize myself with a new topic, followed by in-depth exploration through official documentation. 
To expand my understanding further, I also leverage video tutorials and online courses, such as those on Udemy, for comprehensive learning

Show us some examples of concrete work you’re proud of having done yourself. Please tell us why you are proud of what you sent us. Please be as specific as possible. 
I had the opportunity to take over a project that was in a critical state, with major components, including the admin panel, not functioning. 
After spending time thoroughly understanding the project requirements, I was able to bring the project live within a month. 
The success of this project ultimately contributed to the company’s merger with a larger organization. 
It stands as one of my proudest achievements

Can you give a concrete example of a recent situation where you “took ownership” of a task/project/etc at work and made something truly positive happen? How do you define “taking ownership” of your work? 

I took full ownership of the project and successfully delivered it by coordinating tasks for the team and contributing directly to the backend, which was built using the Symfony framework.
I approach projects with a strong belief in solving customer problems, as this mindset drives meaningful and impactful solutions.

What are the key skills you (would) bring to an asynchronous and remote work environment? What key skills do you feel you need to improve for you to fully thrive in such an environment? 

I have been working remotely for over five years, during which I have developed strong communication skills that enable me to effectively collaborate with both team members and management.
Clear and consistent communication has been essential to maintaining productivity and alignment across all projects.

------ 8. ------ 
Which season of life are you currently in and what are your career goals? For example, are you in a season of life where you work long hours to learn as much as possible? Or in a season where you prioritize work-life balance because you’ve already gained substantial experience? The more transparency you give us, the better we can align and create common goals for your career. 
As my children are growing, I am now in a position where maintaining a healthy work-life balance is a priority. 
It is important for me to be available after office hours to support their development through teaching and training.

What is your approach to monitoring the performance of live web applications? What techniques do you use to maintain good performance levels?
My first step is to analyze the logs and set up real-time alerts in AWS CloudWatch to proactively detect any issues that may impact the website. 
Additionally, I implement performance monitoring tools such as DataDog to gain deeper insights. 
To optimize performance, I focus on reducing database calls by leveraging both client-side and server-side caching strategies.

Could you please send us a sample of some production code you have written and are particularly proud of or find intriguing? Please also explain why you are proud of this code or why you find it interesting. I understand that you are likely under an NDA for some of your code, so it doesn't need to be executable. 

I’m unable to share the code at this time, as my company places trust in me to keep the code within the organization. 
However, if you have a specific task in mind, I’d be happy to implement it and share the relevant code with you upon completion.

There was one project which was done in Laravel and they have written everything in the same calss. 
I have implemented Service class to define the business logic and Repository class to define database queries.
This is how I usually follow the architecture for every project.
